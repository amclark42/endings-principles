         <h2>Data</h2>
         
         <p>Data is the expression of the source information, knowledge, and expertise of our
            researchers. 
            The following principles apply to data:</p>
         
         <ol>
            
            <li>
               Data is stored only in formats that conform to open standards and that are amenable
               to 
               processing (TEI XML, GML, ODF, TXT).
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Archiving:</strong> This principle anticipates long-term preservation of the projects’ components. This
                     principle encourages copying resources such that some version of them might survive.
                     This principle supports record-keeping of the history of the project.</li>
                  <li><strong>Open source:</strong> This principle participates in open source ecosystems, built on well-documented, thoroughly-tested,
                     and widely-adopted technologies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Reuse:</strong> This principle supports reuse of materials outside of the project’s original context.</li>

         <p>Processing code is written and maintained by the project technical staff, and is also

            to version control. Processing code provides all the following functions:</p>
         
         <ol>
            
            <li>
               Relentless validation: all processing includes validation/linting of all inputs 
               and outputs and all validation errors should exit the process and prevent further
               execution 
               until the errors are resolved.

         <h2>Release management</h2>
         
         <p>Release management handles the public release of products. These principles apply
            to release 
            management:</p>
         
         <ol>
            
            <li>
               Releases should be periodical and carefully planned. The “rolling release” model should
               be 
               avoided.
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Provenance:</strong> This principle supports record-keeping of the history of the project.</li>
                  <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> This principle encourages the upkeep of a project’s components, keeping them in sync
                     during the project’s lifecycle. This principle participates in open source ecosystems,
                     built on well-documented, thoroughly-tested, and widely-adopted technologies.</li>

               A release should only be made when the entire product set is coherent, consistent,
               and 
               complete (passing all validation and diagnostic tests).
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Archiving:</strong> This principle anticipates long-term preservation of the projects’ components. This
                     principle encourages copying resources such that some version of them might survive.

               Like editions of print works, each release of a web resource should be clearly identified
               on 
               every page by its build date and some kind of version number.

               Web resources should include detailed instructions for citation, so that end-users

               unambiguously cite a specific page from a specific edition.

               Any moved, retired, or deleted resources no longer available at a previously accessible
               URL 
               should be redirected appropriately.
